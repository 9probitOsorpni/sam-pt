Diesel Railcar Simulator is currently in Early Access on Steam[^1^] and Itch.io[^2^], meaning that the game is not complete and may change further in development. However, the game already offers hours worth of driving with hundreds of Inter-City, semifast, stopping, freight, rescue and empty coaching stock train services. You can also spectate and watch the computer drive the train from any viewpoint, or change trains at any time.
 
The game boasts a detailed physics simulation that replicates the individual components of the transmission and the suspension of each vehicle. The sounds are mostly authentic, recorded from the real trains. The graphics are good enough not to distract, but will still be improved in the future. The game also has optional integrated tutorials that show helpful data on the screen while you're driving, as well as an alternative simplified control mode for beginners. You can use a keyboard, a mouse, a gamepad, a joystick or a RailDriver controller to operate the train.
 
The game includes four British Railways diesel railcar classes with manual gearboxes: 112, 117, 122 and 126; Class 127 railcar with torque converters; and locomotives: Classes 03, 37 and 40. The game also features mineral wagon, guard's van Mk1 coaches and Siphon G parcels van. The game comes with three fictitious routes with different characteristics, totalling over 150 miles: 4- and 2-track main lines, short urban and suburban lines, mountainous rural single track lines.
