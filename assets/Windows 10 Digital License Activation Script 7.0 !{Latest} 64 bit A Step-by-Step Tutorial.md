If you want to activate Windows 10 with a digital license, you can use a script that automates the process for you. A digital license is a method of activation that does not require a product key, but instead links your device to your Microsoft account. You can use a digital license to activate Windows 10 if you upgraded from a genuine copy of Windows 7 or 8.1, or if you bought a new device that came with Windows 10 preinstalled.
 
One of the scripts that you can use to activate Windows 10 with a digital license is the W10 Digital License Activation Script[^1^], which is available on GitHub. This script uses the gatherosstate.exe tool from Microsoft to generate a hardware ID (HWID) file that contains your device's unique information. Then, it uses the slc.dll library to install the digital license on your device. The script also has options to check your activation status and perform other tasks.

To use the W10 Digital License Activation Script, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the script from GitHub[^1^] and extract it to a folder on your device.
2. Right-click on the W10 Digital License Activation Script.cmd file and select Run as administrator.
3. A command prompt window will open with a menu of options. Press 1 to activate Windows 10 with a digital license.
4. The script will run and generate a HWID file in the same folder. It will also install the digital license on your device and show you a confirmation message.
5. Press any key to return to the main menu. Press 2 to check your activation status. You should see that your Windows 10 is permanently activated.
6. Press any key to exit the script.

Congratulations! You have successfully activated Windows 10 with a digital license using a script.
 
Alternatively, you can also use PowerShell to activate Windows 10 with a digital license using another script called Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS)[^3^], which is also available on GitHub. This script supports different activation methods, such as HWID, KMS38, and online KMS. You can find more details and instructions on how to use it on its GitHub page[^3^].

Some advantages of using a digital license to activate Windows 10 are:

- You don't need to enter or remember a product key.
- You can reinstall Windows 10 on the same device without losing your activation.
- You can link your digital license to your Microsoft account and use it to reactivate Windows 10 on a new device or after a hardware change.

Some disadvantages of using a digital license to activate Windows 10 are:

- You need an internet connection to activate Windows 10 for the first time.
- You may encounter activation errors if you change your device's hardware significantly.
- You may need to contact Microsoft support if you run into any issues with your digital license.

In conclusion, using a digital license to activate Windows 10 is a convenient and secure method that does not require a product key. However, you should be aware of the potential problems that may arise if you change your device's hardware or use a different device. You can use scripts like the W10 Digital License Activation Script or the Microsoft Activation Scripts to automate the activation process and save time.
