NetworkView is a professional software application that helps you generate a graphical map of your network using various methods, such as DNS, MAC addresses, SNMP, WMI, NetBIOS and TCP port information. It also bundles network discovery and management tools for the Win32 platform and is able to identify TCP/IP nodes.
 
NetworkView has a clean and intuitive interface that allows you to work with multiple tabs at the same time. You can sort the information by different criteria and switch between different view modes. The program also reveals a graphic box for each node acting as a router, showing the addresses of the connected networks. You can also add comments next to the IP addresses for easier identification.

NetworkView integrates several smart tools, such as MIB browser for setting any value from your MIB2 or proprietary MIBs, WMI browser for connecting to a local or remote node and retrieving all available Win32 classes, and port scanner for checking the alive ports. You can also export the information to a file or copy it to the clipboard.
