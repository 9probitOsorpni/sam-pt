Alucobond is a leading brand of aluminum composite panels that offers a range of design options for facade cladding. One of the most popular systems for installing Alucobond panels is the SZ 20 system, which consists of aluminum profiles that are attached to the substructure and hold the panels in place.
 
In this article, we will explain how to install Alucobond SZ 20 system with DWG files, which are CAD drawings that show the dimensions and details of the profiles and panels. DWG files can help you plan and execute your project with accuracy and efficiency.

## What is Alucobond SZ 20 System?
 
Alucobond SZ 20 system is a cassette system that allows for easy and fast installation of Alucobond panels. The system consists of two main components: the SZ 20 profiles and the SZ 20 clips.
 
- The SZ 20 profiles are aluminum extrusions that are fixed to the substructure with screws or rivets. The profiles have a groove on one side and a flange on the other side. The groove is used to insert the panel edge, while the flange is used to attach the clip.
- The SZ 20 clips are aluminum brackets that are attached to the flange of the profile with screws. The clips have a hook on one end and a slot on the other end. The hook is used to secure the panel edge, while the slot is used to slide onto the next profile.

The SZ 20 system allows for a concealed and flexible connection between the panels and the profiles, creating a smooth and uniform appearance. The system also allows for thermal expansion and contraction of the panels, as well as easy replacement of damaged panels.

## How to Install Alucobond SZ 20 System with DWG Files?
 
To install Alucobond SZ 20 system with DWG files, you will need the following tools and materials:

- Alucobond panels
- SZ 20 profiles
- SZ 20 clips
- Screws or rivets
- Drill or rivet gun
- Tape measure
- Level
- Cutting tool
- DWG files
- CAD software

The installation process can be summarized in four steps:

1. Prepare the substructure and the panels.
2. Fix the profiles to the substructure.
3. Attach the clips to the profiles.
4. Insert the panels into the profiles and clips.

Here are more details for each step:
  
### Step 1: Prepare the substructure and the panels.
  
The substructure is the supporting structure that holds the Alucobond panels. It can be made of wood, metal, or concrete, depending on your project requirements. The substructure should be level, stable, and aligned with your design specifications.
  
The panels are pre-cut to your desired size and shape. You can use DWG files to determine the exact dimensions and angles of each panel. You can also use DWG files to mark the position of each panel on the substructure.
  
### Step 2: Fix the profiles to the substructure.
  
The profiles are fixed to the substructure with screws or rivets, depending on your preference. You can use DWG files to determine the exact location and spacing of each profile. You should ensure that there is enough clearance between the profiles and the substructure for thermal movement and ventilation.
  
The profiles should be aligned horizontally or vertically, depending on your design orientation. You should also ensure that there is enough overlap between adjacent profiles for a secure connection.
  
### Step 3: Attach the clips to the profiles.
  
The clips are attached to the flange of each profile with screws. You can use DWG files to determine the exact number and position of each clip. You should ensure that there is enough distance between adjacent clips for thermal movement and ventilation.
