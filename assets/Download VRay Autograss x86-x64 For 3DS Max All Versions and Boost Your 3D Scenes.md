To use VRay Autograss, you need to create a VRay material and assign it to a plane or a terrain object. Then, go to the material editor and select the VRay material. In the maps rollout, click on the diffuse slot and choose VRayAutograss from the list. A new window will open where you can adjust the parameters of the grass, such as color, density, length, variation, etc. You can also load presets from the drop-down menu or create your own.
 
When you are happy with the settings, click OK and render your scene. You will see that VRay Autograss automatically generates grass blades on your surface, following the contours and textures of your object. You can also use VRay lights and shadows to enhance the realism of your grass.
 
VRay Autograss is a powerful and easy-to-use plugin that can help you create stunning grass scenes in 3DS Max. However, it is not a free or legal software, so use it at your own risk and discretion.
