Spatial Manager for AutoCAD is a powerful AutoCAD plug-in designed for AutoCAD users who need to import, export, transform and manage spatial data in a simple, fast and inexpensive way, which includes many functionalities not seen so far in AutoCAD[^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to use some of the main features of Spatial Manager for AutoCAD 28, such as importing and exporting spatial data, displaying background maps, creating terrain models and thematic maps, and transforming coordinate systems.
  
## Importing and Exporting Spatial Data
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD allows you to import and export spatial data between AutoCAD drawings and geospatial files, data servers or data stores[^2^]. You can choose from a wide range of data providers, such as Shapefiles, KML, GeoJSON, PostGIS, SQL Server Spatial, Oracle Spatial or GeoRaster, etc.[^1^]. You can also import data from elevation services or Google Earth[^2^].

To import spatial data into AutoCAD, you can use the SPMIMPORT command or the Import button in the Spatial Manager palette. You can select the source file or data provider, the target layer or table, the import options (such as coordinate system transformation, object properties, data fields, etc.), and preview the data before importing it. The imported data will be converted into AutoCAD objects and extended entity data (EED/XDATA)[^1^].
 
To export spatial data from AutoCAD, you can use the SPMEXPORT command or the Export button in the Spatial Manager palette. You can select the objects to export, the destination file or data provider, the export options (such as coordinate system transformation, object properties, data fields, etc.), and preview the data before exporting it. The exported data will include the extended entity data (EED/XDATA) of the objects as alphanumeric data tables[^1^].

## Displaying Background Maps
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD enables you to display dynamic background maps from providers such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing, MapBox, Ordnance Survey, etc., or configure your own maps from TMS, WMS or WMTS servers[^2^]. You can use these maps to enhance your drawings with georeferenced information and imagery.
 
To display background maps in AutoCAD, you can use the SPMBGMAPS command or the Background Maps button in the Spatial Manager palette. You can select the map provider and style, adjust the transparency and brightness of the map, and zoom and pan to navigate the map. You can also capture a static image of the map and save it as an AutoCAD raster image[^2^].
  
## Creating Terrain Models and Thematic Maps
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD allows you to create terrain models and contours from 3D data or from elevation services[^2^]. You can use these models to analyze the terrain features and elevation profiles of your projects.
 
To create terrain models in AutoCAD, you can use the SPMTERRAIN command or the Terrains button in the Spatial Manager palette. You can select the source of elevation data (such as a point cloud, a surface model, a raster image or an elevation service), define the terrain parameters (such as resolution, smoothing factor, contour interval, etc.), and generate a 3D mesh or a set of contour polylines[^2^].
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD also enables you to create thematic maps by coloring objects depending on their field values[^2^]. You can use these maps to visualize spatial patterns and trends in your data.
 
To create thematic maps in AutoCAD, you can use the SPMCOLORBYVALUE command or the Thematic Maps button in the Spatial Manager palette. You can select the objects to colorize, choose the field to use as a criterion (such as numeric or text values), define the color range or palette (such as gradient or discrete colors), and apply a legend to display the color values[^2^].
  
## Transforming Coordinate Systems
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD lets you transform coordinate systems of your drawings or selected objects[^2^]. You can choose
